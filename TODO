I started this project to learn more about colour theory, and to take a break
from my main project.  I only worked on it for maybe two months.  I had to rush
it because of my finals and because I wanted to get back to my main project.  I
did rewrite the core several times, but I never finished implementing all the
features that I wanted Kolourmatica to have.  Here is a list of things that
needs to be done, in order of importance:

1. Implement full orthographic view.  Currently only front view is supported.
2. Implement zooming.
3. Improve rendering speed.  Currently rendering is fully multi-threaded, but it
   is slow.  It is a very simple ray tracer, and it sure has a lot of room for
   improvements.
4. Implement heads-up-display, such as grids and guides and other useful info
   about the current colour spaces.
5. Implement or remove the 'accuracy' option.
